## A simple 'trampoline' representation of gravity. A project to help me learn C++

**My approach:**
- Learning the basics of C++
- Defining gravity
- Mess around with vectors and movement

Not really sure how to go about this really, will update my approach as I actually build stuff.

Next steps;
- determine the logic for finding the gravitational constant for a planet.
- organization; main function will have logic for determening the gravitational force exherted by a planet
- define the stats of two 'planets'
