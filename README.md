## A simple 'trampoline' representation of gravity. A project to help me learn C++

**My approach:**
- Learning the basics of C++
- Defining gravity
- Mess around with vectors and movement

Not really sure how to go about this really, will update my approach as I actually build stuff.

Next steps;
- determine the logic for finding the gravitational constant for a planet. (kinda sorta got this 1)
- define the stats of two 'planets' (kinda sorted this)
- learn about c++ vector array's, should help with movement.
- Will have to brush up on my trigonometry.
- ehm, what else. Oh right, draw circle with triangles, add volume for sphere. 
- organization; main function will have logic for determening the gravitational force exherted by a planet
    - I'll need to learn how classes/constructs work so I can have individual planets within them, then figure out how to make them interact if they enter each others 'area of effect', so to speak.

Updates;
- Finally got OpenGL/GLTW window working.
